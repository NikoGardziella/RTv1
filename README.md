# RTv1


RTv1 is a simple ray tracing program. The project was developed as a part of 42 school program. It parses a 3D scene from a file and applies ray tracing algorithm to render the given scene.

When it comes to render 3 dimensions computer generated images there is 2 possible
approaches: “rasterization”, which is used by almost all graphic engines because of it’s
efficiency and “ray tracing.” The ray tracing method is more expensive and as a result
not adapted to real time but it produces a high degree of visual realism.
